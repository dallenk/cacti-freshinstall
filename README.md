# cacti-freshinstall
A quick install script for Cacti NMS to a clean fresh install of Ubuntu 24.04


I'll update this later with more detail, but in a nutshell this will install Cacti and all dependancies.  It will also install cactid/spine OR cmd for the poller.

Tested only with Ubuntu 24.04 on a VM on a clean, fresh OS install "out of the box"
